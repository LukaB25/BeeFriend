## Introduction

- BeeFriend is a social media web app that focuses on making friends and connecting with people.

- BeeFriend is targeted towards a wide range of consumers in order to connect with old, new and future friends. The web app lets users share posts and images, send, accept and deny friend requests, explore other users posts, like and comment on them, view their profiles and bio's on them as well as message with other users to start private discussions and conversations.

- I got the idea for this project as I was building a project along side the learning materials. I wanted to expand on the idea of the learning project and create a social media site that would let users interact and connect. The concept for the web app was developed as a play on words and I used the Befriend concept with the Bee, making it a figurative hive for users to buzz and discuss matters in.
